Chess Piece Movement Simulation (in C)
This project simulates the movement of three chess pieces—Rook, Bishop, and Queen—using different loop structures in C.
Each piece moves a fixed number of spaces according to its rules: the Rook moves horizontally, the Bishop moves diagonally, and the Queen moves in any direction.
The goal is to demonstrate the use of for, while, and do-while loops by printing the movement direction of each step on the console.
